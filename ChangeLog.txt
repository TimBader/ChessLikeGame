Chess-Like Game Change Log
------

[ v0.0.5 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added zoom functionality, with adjustable attributes
- Added Temporary UI for some nice instructions
- Can now click on the same tile when selecting spawned unit's rotation to skip
- Made sure with each movetype that the game will end when the king is captured
- Added and Integrated color palettes for each team, right now supporting up to 4 colors as well as integration with sprites
- Provided an example sprite Unit that helps displays how the colorization works with team color pallets set as
- Double tapping escape will exit the game

*Extra
- Set all images to use point filtering
- Removed a lot of commented out junk
- Background is now black... since its cool
- Normal tiles are now grey
- When rotating, the tile the unit is already facing is now colored grey
- Units's depth is not based on unity's y position so units higher on the screen/field appear to be behind units who are farther down from them
- Units now have an global offset for them when it comes to positioning

[ v0.0.4 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Made the process of creating a new unit less cluttered.  MoveTypeObjects no longer require List<> type objects but now require simple arrays reducing number of lines required
- Created a static Util class that holds generic functions that can be used anywhere
- Fixed the not properly aligned rotation indicator

*Extra Details
- hexCoordToPixelCoord() from SpawnTiles now allows the ability to ignore the offsets (Issue behind rotation indicator's offset)

[ v0.0.3 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added a rotation indicator for easier to tell rotation
- Changed a Knight and Ranged Unit's movements.

[ v0.0.2 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Redid the way units are created in code, reduced the number of lines needed but made it slightly more complicated
- Now move types that can not be used will not show up while cycling through alternate movements
- Sneakily added a way to stop the unit that just spawned from being able to move until the next turn... took three lines and a global variable with no planning so this might back and bight me :P

*Extra Details
- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow units to move if only One of there moves is not moveable
- Add a few helper functions that can help build List<T> from T[] since arrays are easier and cleaner to build in code

[ v0.0.1 ]
Author: Tim Bader (The person to blame for issues)
- MoveTypes can now figure out whether or not its possible to move (Not quite completely tested)
- Now can spawn units anytime through nice code function (Allows for easier spawning and testing, showed)
- Game will end if a team has no units that can move (hard to to test :P without the above)

*Extra Details (Less important changes)
- Added a new abstract function for MoveTypes that can figure out if they can move or not (canMove);
- Can no longer click on another unit when selecting movement to switch the selected unit
- Removed the code that stopped the ability to click a rotate to tile that has a unit on it... dont know how it got there :P
- Added a new spawnUnit function that can handle spawning units for us... should of had this for a while :D
- Made SpriteResourceManager use static functions
- Getting team colors are not stored staticly in TeamControllerScript
