Chess-Like Game Change Log
------

[ v0.0.2 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Redid the way units are created in code, reduced the number of lines needed but made it slightly more complicated
- Now move types that can not be used will not show up while cycling through alternate movements
- Sneakily added a way to stop the unit that just spawned from being able to move until the next turn... took three lines and a global variable with no planning so this might back and bight me :P

*Extra Details
- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow units to move if only One of there moves is not moveable
- Add a few helper functions that can help build List<T> from T[] since arrays are easier and cleaner to build in code

[ v0.0.1 ]
Author: Tim Bader (The person to blame for issues)
- MoveTypes can now figure out whether or not its possible to move (Not quite completely tested)
- Now can spawn units anytime through nice code function (Allows for easier spawning and testing, showed)
- Game will end if a team has no units that can move (hard to to test :P without the above)

*Extra Details (Less important changes)
- Added a new abstract function for MoveTypes that can figure out if they can move or not (canMove);
- Can no longer click on another unit when selecting movement to switch the selected unit
- Removed the code that stopped the ability to click a rotate to tile that has a unit on it... dont know how it got there :P
- Added a new spawnUnit function that can handle spawning units for us... should of had this for a while :D
- Made SpriteResourceManager use static functions
- Getting team colors are not stored staticly in TeamControllerScript
