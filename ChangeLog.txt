Chess-Like Game Change Log
------

[ v0.0.11 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added in Axel's art stuff.  The Spearman art is not attached to a character since I ran out of temp chars and im too lazy to add another... James get on the rest of the chars

[ v0.0.10 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added multiple icons and systems for said systems for movement, rotations and many more
- Fixed a ton of bugs with reposition, charge, slide, and path movetypes
- Commented out the tile coloring stuff as we now has somewhat a proper UI

[ v0.0.9 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added new character images to assets and provided a non-sensical implementation

*Extra
- Clicking on the selected unit in RotatedSelectedUnitMode will skip


[ v0.0.8 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Allowed the RepositionUnit to spawn
- Added a reposition unit into the map for quick testing

[ v0.0.7 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added RepositionUnit as an example
- Added the reposition move to the pool
- Added the debugging ability to see what hex coord is under the mouse by pressing "q"
- Redid the Ranged Move Type to allow for multiple attack tiles that are also manually grouped
- Redid Ranged Unit to demonstrate the new Ranged Move Type
- Movetypes cache data to help improve performance and code cleanness
- When a unit rotates it tells all of its move types that it did for those movetypes to re-cache what ever they need to
- Units get their own personal UnitInfo class that is cloned from the created ones in TempUnitInfo
- MoveTypes now have clone, verify, and new constructor
- All move types have in their constructor the ability to verify the data to see if it is clear... this should happen when you first create the info in TempUnitInfo Section

*Extra
- MovementObjects now can have their "ClickedInMode" func be called when any tile has been clicked excluding State NONE and SELECTED
- Slide / Jump / Path Move can no longer move to a tile that doesnt have state ATTACKABLE or SELECTED
- Unit Info now stored as a class
- Redid the first color in the team color pallets for team 0 and team 1

[ v0.0.6 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Redid the NormalMoveType into PathMoveType
- PathMoveType now allows the pathing to be in-order (of list position) that once blocked doesnt allow for subsequent positions to be moved to
- PathMoveType also contains a inner-class that acts to hold a position and a corresponding "can move to" variable called PathPos
- Implemented spawning the spawning guards rotation
- Redid the system that doesnt allow just spawned units to move right after spawning, that fixed a bug
- Any moves that require a direction now take RelativeDirections instead of an interpreted adjacent hex position.

*Extra
- Added a quick PathMoveType::PathPos creation function to the place where characters are created for easier creation
- Fixed a bug with Charge Move where the code was not correct and made no sense
- Created a function to get a direction to a certain tile, that returns none if it is not in any particular direction
- Fixed Charge Move from simply deleting all other units even if it is not in the correct charge path
- Now the Charge and Slide move can move with indefinite range if set with a range of -1
- Fixed a Ranged Checking Move bug

[ v0.0.5 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added zoom functionality, with adjustable attributes
- Added Temporary UI for some nice instructions
- Can now click on the same tile when selecting spawned unit's rotation to skip
- Made sure with each movetype that the game will end when the king is captured
- Added and Integrated color palettes for each team, right now supporting up to 4 colors as well as integration with sprites
- Provided an example sprite Unit that helps displays how the colorization works with team color pallets set as
- Double tapping escape will exit the game

*Extra
- Set all images to use point filtering
- Removed a lot of commented out junk
- Background is now black... since its cool
- Normal tiles are now grey
- When rotating, the tile the unit is already facing is now colored grey
- Units's depth is not based on unity's y position so units higher on the screen/field appear to be behind units who are farther down from them
- Units now have an global offset for them when it comes to positioning

[ v0.0.4 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Made the process of creating a new unit less cluttered.  MoveTypeObjects no longer require List<> type objects but now require simple arrays reducing number of lines required
- Created a static Util class that holds generic functions that can be used anywhere
- Fixed the not properly aligned rotation indicator

*Extra Details
- hexCoordToPixelCoord() from SpawnTiles now allows the ability to ignore the offsets (Issue behind rotation indicator's offset)

[ v0.0.3 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Added a rotation indicator for easier to tell rotation
- Changed a Knight and Ranged Unit's movements.

[ v0.0.2 ]
Author: Tim Bader
- Redid the way units are created in code, reduced the number of lines needed but made it slightly more complicated
- Now move types that can not be used will not show up while cycling through alternate movements
- Sneakily added a way to stop the unit that just spawned from being able to move until the next turn... took three lines and a global variable with no planning so this might back and bight me :P

*Extra Details
- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow units to move if only One of there moves is not moveable
- Add a few helper functions that can help build List<T> from T[] since arrays are easier and cleaner to build in code

[ v0.0.1 ]
Author: Tim Bader (The person to blame for issues)
- MoveTypes can now figure out whether or not its possible to move (Not quite completely tested)
- Now can spawn units anytime through nice code function (Allows for easier spawning and testing, showed)
- Game will end if a team has no units that can move (hard to to test :P without the above)

*Extra Details (Less important changes)
- Added a new abstract function for MoveTypes that can figure out if they can move or not (canMove);
- Can no longer click on another unit when selecting movement to switch the selected unit
- Removed the code that stopped the ability to click a rotate to tile that has a unit on it... dont know how it got there :P
- Added a new spawnUnit function that can handle spawning units for us... should of had this for a while :D
- Made SpriteResourceManager use static functions
- Getting team colors are not stored staticly in TeamControllerScript
